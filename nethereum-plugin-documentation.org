The scope of this project is to create a Unity asset that will serve as an interface of sorts for the Nethereum library. The asset will expose some functionalities to make it easier to integrate Ethereum on an application developed using Unity.

* The Nethereum Plugin

There are currently two ways to install the plugin on Unity base on what you have. To start off, run Unity Hub and open your project. Choose the installation method that suites you below.

   - After the installation is done, the plugin will be available inside the ~plugins~ folder that's been created.

2. Using Raw DLL

   - Create a new folder called ~plugins~ inside the ~Assets~ folder of your Unity project.

After finishing the plugin installation you must set now the .NET environment.

- On the top menu of Unity, select ~Edit -> Project Settings -> Player~.
- The inspector at the right will show several sections. Scroll to ~Other Settings -> Configuration~ and change the ~Scripting Runtime Version~ to ~.NET 4.x Equivalent~. It will prompt you to restart Unity.

** Plugin Usage

Once the plugin has been correctly installed on your project, you can start using it. To do so, first you will have to create an instance of the plugin's class:

#+NAME: ref:01
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
var pluginInstance = new NethereumPlugin();
#+END_SRC

#+LATEX: \noindent
The instance will expose all the available methods for you to use.
